      This is what makes me amazing in my personal life
    </h2>
    <p>
      I have a huge passion for outdoor recreational motorsports. I love to
      modify, and tune import cars. I also enjoy snowmobiling in the great
      trails of NY and jetskiing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also participate in team and individual sports such as beach volleyball,
      track, mountain and road biking.

      Overall, I am a very active person that takes pride in a variety of
      hobbies. Traits that explain my passion for outdoor recreational sports
      are competitivness, adventure, and the desire for better performance. I
      never jetski and snowmobile at the same place as I feel a need to explore
      new places that will continue to test and improve my skills. It is like
      creating a competition within myself. I am always looking for better
      performance within myself and my favorite recreation equipment.
